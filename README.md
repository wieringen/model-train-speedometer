==================================================

Documentation
----------

All the documentation you need to make this project is located [here](http://baijs.com/model-train-speedometer). The grunt build file in this repo is only used to package the project in a neat zip so I can deploy it more easily to my website.

TODO
----------

Support multiple sender carts.
Cleanup code and write better docs.
